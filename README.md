# Parentime

Parentime is a proof of concept application designed for the management of alternating parental custody schedules in a cascading manner. This application is built to facilitate the organization and visualization of custody schedules, ensuring that both parents are adequately involved in their child's life.

## Key Components and Features

### 1. Constraint Definition and Encoding:
- Hard and Soft Constraints: The application incorporates both hard and soft constraints to ensure flexibility and adaptability in creating custody schedules.
- CFE and Its Constraints: The CFE is encoded in JSON format, indicating a structured approach to handling complex data and constraints.
### 2. Problem Modeling and Optimization:
- Constraint Programming: The application employs constraint programming, a key technique in artificial intelligence, to model and solve the custody scheduling problem.
- Metaheuristics: It also utilizes metaheuristics for optimization, ensuring efficient and effective solutions.
### 3. Variable Neighborhood Search:
- Solution Generation: The application is equipped with mechanisms for generating solutions and employs local search movements and shaking movements to explore the solution space effectively.
- Experimentation with JAMES: The project includes experiments with the JAMES framework, indicating a multi-faceted approach to solution exploration and optimization.
### 4. Parentime Application:
- Objective: The primary goal is to provide a practical and user-friendly platform for parents to manage and visualize custody schedules.
- Implementation: It allows the definition of a “circle” either through an “object” method or an “XML” method, offering flexibility in data input and management.
- Constraint Addition and Schedule Calculation: Users can add constraints and compute schedules, making the application adaptable to varying needs and complexities.
### 5. Technical Details:
- XML Encoding: The application supports XML encoding, as seen in the detailed example provided in the document, where persons (children and tutors) and agendas are defined with specific attributes and entries.

## Application Workflow

- Circle Definition: Users can define a circle, which likely represents a group of individuals involved in the custody schedule, including children and parents or guardians.
- Constraint Addition: Users have the flexibility to add various constraints to tailor the custody schedules according to specific needs, requirements, and agreements.
- Schedule Calculation: The application calculates optimal or feasible schedules based on the defined circles and constraints, ensuring that the resulting schedules are practical and adhere to the set constraints.
- Visualization: With features like the PrettyPrinter utility class, users can visualize the custody schedules, making them easy to understand and follow.
- Optimization: The application employs advanced optimization techniques, including variable neighborhood search and metaheuristics, to ensure that the custody schedules are not only feasible but also optimized for the involved parties.

## Conclusion

Parentime is a Proof of Concept (POC) designed to address the intricate and dynamic nature of managing alternating parental custody schedules. It encapsulates a blend of advanced artificial intelligence and optimization techniques to ensure the creation of feasible and optimized custody schedules, considering all legal and personal constraints.

As a POC, Parentime demonstrates the potential and foundational structure for a comprehensive solution. It is intricately designed, showcasing features and capabilities that can be expanded and enhanced to cater to a broader spectrum of scenarios and complexities. The application is not just a tool but a starting point, a blueprint ripe for further development and refinement.

We openly invite developers, AI enthusiasts, and individuals with a keen interest in this domain to explore, critique, and improve upon this project.
